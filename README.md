This project is intended to learn the basics of OpenGL and how it can be used in games and other 3D applications.
I am using the GLSL Library and have learned the basic structure of OpenGL of how to setup and the base skeleton of the GLSL class.
Below is an example to create a circle using simple trigonometry and GLSL code, by using traingles to draw a circle. The steps define the amount of traingles to be drawn, the more the steps the smoother the circle's edges become. Below I playtest different stpe values to get curved edges.
